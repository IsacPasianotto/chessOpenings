<h3>How to enter a move?</h3>
  <p>
    The program accepts as input the moves indicated in the <strong>algebraic notation</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each <em>square</em> is identified by a twosome consisting of a <em>lowercase</em> letter and a number, starting from the lower left corner a1 to the upper right corner h8.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each <em>piece</em>, except pawns, is identified with a <em>capital letter:</em><br />
        King ♔ = K, Queen ♕ = Q, Rook ♖ = R, Bishop ♗ = B, Knight ♘ = N.
      </li>
      <li>
        The notation requires that the piece to be moved is indicated first, followed by the name of the arrival square.
        <br />For example: <em>e4, Nh6, Qd3, ...</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        When two equal pieces can move in the same square, the name of the column of origin is also indicated by placing it before the name of the destination square, if the ambiguity persists, the name of the line is indicated. 
        <br />Supposing to have the knights in the houses e2 and g2 and want to move one to f4, the correct writing is <em>Nef4</em> or <em>Ngf4</em>.
        <br />Instead if the knigths are in the a6 and a8 squares, the correct writing is <em>N8c7</em> or <em>N6c7</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        When an opponent's piece is taken, the letter x is placed before the square of arrival, and in the case of pawns, their column before the move.
        <br />For example: <em>exd5</em> or <em>Nxf6</em>.
      </li>
      <li> 
        In the case of a check, the symbol + is inserted at the end, in the case of checkmate the symbol #.
      </li>
      <li>
        The pawn promotion is indicated with the symbol = followed by the piece it is replaced with (e.g <em>a8=Q</em>).
        <br />Castle move is indicated with <em>O-O</em> if the king goes to g-column, otherwise with <em>O-O-O</em>.
      </li> 
    </ul>
        For greater comfort, the possibility to click on a square to indicate the desired move has been added (any ambiguities have been resolved by making the program suggest the statistically most likely move among the possible ones).

      Finally, it is possible to obtain the same effect as the <em>move</em> button by pressing <em>enter</em> or with a <em>double click</em>.
      Similarly the combinations <em>ctrl+Z</em> and <em>ctrl+R</em> replace the <em>undo</em> and <em>reset</em> key respectively.
