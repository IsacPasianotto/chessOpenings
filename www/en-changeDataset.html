<p>The program can also be used with its own dataset.</p>
<p>
  To work correctly, the input file must have a <em><strong>.csv</strong></em> extension.
  Moreover it must contain the following variables named in this way:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><u>winner</u></em>: &nbsp; Winner of the match.</li>
  <li><em><u>white_rating</u></em>: &nbsp;ELO score of the player with the white pieces.</li>
  <li><em><u>black_rating</u></em>: &nbsp;ELO score of the player with the black pieces.</li>
  <li><em><u>opening_code</u></em>: &nbsp;ECO code that identifies the played game.</li>
  <li><em><u>opening_name</u></em>: &nbsp;Name of the opening played in the match.</li>
  <li><em><u>moves</u>:</em>&nbsp;Game move sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other variables present will be ignored.</p>
<p>The program only works if the <em><u>winner</u></em> variable is formatted according to one of the following two alterantives:</p>
<p>
  - &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;draw&quot;<br>
  - &quot;1-0&quot;, &quot;0-1&quot;, &quot;1/2-1/2&quot;
</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the file size limit is set to 256mB, to upload a larger file just modify the following line in the <span class="Code">global.R</span>  file according to your needs:</p>
<p><span class="Code">options(shiny.maxRequestSize=256*1024^2)</span></p>
<p>The program automatically sets the default value of <em>R</em> to 5mB when it stops.</p>
